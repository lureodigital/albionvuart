 Albion Vu is an architect, fashion designer and an abstract painter sharing his life between NYC and Martha's Vineyard.
Born and raised in Eastern Europe. Moved to the USA right after he graduated in Architecture and Design. Between all this time he has practiced abstract painting and fashion design and constantly creating pieces that are a mark of his artistic life.

Speaking of that, some of the main sources of his inspiration to make art but not only that followed the artist throughout 15 years are COLOR, SHAPES, SILUETES, STRUCTURE, TEXTURE, DEPTH, CAOS, SIMPLICITY. A journey that will follow you through the entire observation of his art pieces.
Albion is an artist who his professional creative career has taken him from fashion design to abstract painting to sketching to interior design and molding all these together on a piece of canvas or paper curation walls and space with the art he makes.

His painting is abstract, expressive, gestural with some figurative resurgences ready to hide or be dissolved. He is inspired by the humans, the silhouettes, the crowds, the look, the face, the shadow, the light, the depth of a conversation. In this way, he approaches the relationship of the individual to the world, the fragile human condition.
He likes the freedom of the line, of shape, it is an intuitive painting, a fight between chaos and order, between simple and complex.
Large scale is his specialty, but he has collected numerous pieces on the smaller scale as well

His work is held in private collections in the US and Europe.
Part of the galleries and beautifully curated homes all around.

Currently sharing his life between NYC and Martha's Vineyard where he operates as an artist.

ARTISTS STATEMENT:

Color is the essence of beauty and energy that permeates our world. It has the remarkable ability to evoke emotions and stir deep feelings within us. I have always been captivated by the interplay of color and shape. When these two elements converge, the possibilities for creating art become boundless. For me personally, however, painting transcends the mere combination of color and shape. It is a process that begins with an emotion or feeling, which then spills out onto the canvas.
I connect with different cultures, different people and give them a piece of me from who they are as a reflection of admiration for something different. For a difference. 

Some of my paintings emerge from spontaneous impulses, where my inner emotions take control and guide my paintbrush. They become raw expressions of my inner self. Other artworks are journeys of exploration, even surprising me with their unfolding pathways. Through my paintings, I strive to convey my own perspective of the world and create an emotional connection with the viewer. I aspire to capture fleeting moments and freeze them in time on the canvas, inviting others to share in the experience.

Painting allows me to communicate beyond words, to communicate in the language of colors, shapes, and emotions. It is a profound and intimate means of expression, enabling me to convey the depth of my perception and invite others to join me on this artistic journey. It’s a form of meditation for me and it has been so for over +15 years now. It simply takes over me.
“It takes me to start painting so I can stop everything around me move.”
